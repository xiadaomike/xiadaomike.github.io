So I got my HHKB Pro2 Type S keyboard yesterday. In the beginning things went
pretty smoothly as I followed the set-up guidelines on
[elitekeyboards](https://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=pfu_keyboards,hhkbpro2&pid=pdkb400wns).

But I soon realized that the Fn key is quite useful yet positioned at an awkward
location. Originally I thought I would be able to get rid of arrow keys by using
all kinds of vim style key mappings in chrome, terminal, and other applications.
It turns out though, as I would like to use command suggestions in iterm with
fish shell, arrow keys can still come handy from time to time. So I spent a
decent amount of time looking around online, hoping to find a way of remapping
Fn to alt key since the DIP-switch does not support that.

Eventually I found out that I could achieve this simply by turning on SW2, SW4
and SW5, and then remap option(alt) key to command in the keyboard setup on mac.
Now the keyboard works the way I want it to and I am really enjoying it!

For those who are curious, the wrist rest I am using is a 100% wood one made by
FILCO. You can find it on
[amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Filco-Wood-Minila-Keyboards-FWPR/dp/B00CHK39WW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1413531623&sr=8-1&keywords=filco+palm+rest).
